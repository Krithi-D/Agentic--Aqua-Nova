## üîç Problem Statement  
Oceans are under constant threat from pollution, climate change, and unregulated human activity. Traditional water monitoring is manual and delayed, which limits rapid response to threats like algal blooms, oil spills, or oxygen depletion.  

This project aims to create an **AI-powered smart buoy system** that can continuously track ocean parameters, detect anomalies, and send real-time alerts to local authorities and stakeholders.

---

## üí° Our Solution  
We simulate a **solar-powered smart buoy** with sensors that monitor:
- Temperature  
- Salinity  
- Turbidity  
- pH  
- Dissolved Oxygen  
- Oil Spill Detection  
- Microplastics  
- GPS location  

The system:
- Sends real-time data to a simulated backend  
- Uses basic ML for anomaly detection  
- Calculates a Marine Health Index score  
- Shows everything on a live dashboard  
- Sends alerts when environmental thresholds are crossed
